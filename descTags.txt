The -T (timing template) option allows us to specify a value from 0 to 5. This sets one of the timing modes. The timing modes have great names: paranoid (0), sneaky (1), polite (2), normal (3), aggressive (4), and insane (5). The lower the number, the less impact nmap will have on the bandwidth and other network users.
